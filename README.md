# VS Code Profile Assignment

**Objective**: Import and activate a VS Code profile specifically designed for web development with essential extensions and settings.

## What You'll Accomplish

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Import and activate a professional VS Code profile for web development
- Set up essential extensions: HTMLHint, Live Server, and Stylelint
- Download and integrate project assets from external sources
- Test your development environment with Live Server

## Why Use This Profile?

This profile contains both essential extensions and optimized settings for web development.

**Extensions Included:**
- **HTMLHint** - Analyzes your HTML code and flags errors, bad practices, and accessibility issues
- **Live Server** - Creates a local web server with live reload functionality
- **Stylelint** - Analyzes your CSS/SCSS code for errors and enforces coding standards

**Settings Included:** Auto-formatting on save, consistent indentation, Git integration, and optimized validation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Import the Profile

1. **Open VS Code** (any project or empty window is fine)

2. **Access the Profiles panel**
   - Look for the **gear icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) in the bottom-left corner of VS Code
   - Click the gear icon
   - Select **"Profiles"** from the menu

3. **Import the profile**
   - In the Profiles panel, look for **"Import Profile..."** 
   - Click **"Import Profile..."**
   - In the Import Profile dialog, navigate to your repository folder
   - Select the `wdi.code-profile` file
   - Click **"Open"**

4. **Create the profile**
   - The Profile creation form will open with the profile contents pre-selected
   - Review the profile contents and click **"Create"** to import the profile

### Step 2: Activate the Profile

1. **Make it active**
   - The imported profile will now be available in your Profiles list
   - Click **"Use this Profile for Current Window"** to activate it
   - VS Code will reload with the new profile settings and extensions

2. **Verify it's active**
   - Look in the bottom-left corner of VS Code - the gear icon should now show a **graduation cap** (üéì) instead of the regular gear
   - This mortar board icon indicates that "Web Dev I for GRID" is your active profile
   - Check Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) - you should see HTMLHint, Live Server, and Stylelint installed

### Step 3: Download the Missing Image File

The `index.html` file in your repository references an image that needs to be downloaded:

1. **Download the welcome image**
   - Right-click on this link: [welcome-cats-dots.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RVCC-IDMX/shared-assets/main/welcome-cats-dots.svg)
   - Select **"Save link as..."** or **"Download linked file as..."**
   - Save the file as `welcome-cats-dots.svg` directly in your repository folder (the same folder as `index.html`)
   - **Important**: Make sure the filename is exactly `welcome-cats-dots.svg`

2. **Test with Live Server**
   - Right-click on `index.html` in VS Code
   - Select **"Open with Live Server"**
   - Your browser should open showing the welcome page with the cat animation
   - If you see the image, everything is working correctly!

### Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes

Since you've added a new file (`welcome-cats-dots.svg`) to your repository, you need to commit and push it to complete the assignment:

1. **Stage the new file**
   - Open the Source Control panel (click the branch icon in the left sidebar)
   - You should see `welcome-cats-dots.svg` listed under "Changes"
   - Click the **+** button next to the filename to stage it

2. **Create a commit**
   - Type a commit message in the text box: `Add welcome image for Live Server demo`
   - Click the **checkmark** button (‚úì) to commit

3. **Push to GitHub**
   - Click the **three dots** (...) in the Source Control panel
   - Select **"Push"** from the menu
   - Your changes will be uploaded to GitHub

## Assignment Complete!

Once you've successfully imported and activated the profile, downloaded the image file, viewed the working webpage in Live Server, and pushed your changes to GitHub, you have completed this assignment. Your VS Code is now configured with professional web development tools.

## Beginner's Guide

**What is a VS Code Profile?** Think of it like a "preset" for your text editor - it contains specific tools, colors, and settings all bundled together.

**What are Extensions?** Extensions are like apps for VS Code that add new features and capabilities.

**Why do we all use the same setup?** Having the same VS Code setup makes learning easier and more consistent across the class.
